    abstract = {The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the feces of infected patients and wastewater has drawn attention, not only to the possibility of fecal-oral transmission but also to the use of wastewater as an epidemiological tool. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches, due to a lack of diagnostic capacity, and their application to only a small proportion of the population. As in previous pandemics, statistics, particularly the proportion of the population infected, are believed to be widely underestimated. Furthermore, analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers. Threfore, community-scale surveillance, including wastewater-based epidemiology, can bridge the broader community and the clinic, becoming a valuable indirect epidemiological prediction tool for SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic viruses. This article summarizes current knowledge and discusses the critical factors for implementing wastewater-based epidemiology of COVID-19.},

    abstract = {Wastewater is a complex matrix containing a wide range of chemical and biological markers of human activity. Relating concentrations of these “waste” materials in wastewater influent streams to population-scale use, consumption, or rates of exposure, can provide important qualitative or quantitative information on the activity of inhabitants within a given wastewater catchment. Many publications in this field of study have focussed on the usage of pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, tobacco and alcohol. However, many other potential applications are emerging which can contribute useful knowledge on human health, exposure to industrial chemicals, infectious diseases or pathogens and antibiotic resistance. This review summarises the established wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) biomarkers, and presents a critical review of the current capabilities of WBE. We further discuss possible future strategies and challenges anticipated in analysing wastewater to measure chemical markers of population health as well as biological markers of microbial exposure and disease.},

    abstract = {The benefits of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for tracking the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, have become apparent since the start of the pandemic. However, most sampling occurs at the wastewater treatment plant influent and therefore monitors the entire catchment, encompassing multiple municipalities, and is conducted using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which only quantifies one target. Sequencing methods provide additional strain information and also can identify other pathogens, broadening the applicability of WBE to beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we demonstrate feasibility of sampling at the neighborhood or building complex level using qPCR, targeted sequencing, and untargeted metatranscriptomics (total RNA sequencing) to provide a refined understanding of the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains and identify other pathogens circulating in the community. We demonstrate feasibility of tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the neighborhood, hospital, and nursing home level with the ability to detect one COVID-19 positive out of 60 nursing home residents. The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital. Targeted wastewater-based sequencing over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations fluctuate in the viral population. Clades and shifts in mutation profiles within the community were monitored and could be used to determine if vaccine or diagnostics need to be adapted to ensure continued efficacy. Furthermore, untargeted RNA sequencing identified several other pathogens in the samples. Therefore, untargeted RNA sequencing could be used to identify new outbreaks or emerging pathogens beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.},

    abstract = {In recent months, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been shown to be an important tool for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population. In this study, a detection methodology for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (wildtype and variants of concern) in wastewater was developed based on the detection of different target genes (E and ORF1ab) by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and digital droplet PCR. This methodology was used to determine the SARS-CoV-2 concentration and the proportion of N501Y mutation in raw sewage of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Karlsruhe in south-western Germany over a period of 1 year (June 2020 to July 2021). Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations with reported COVID-19 cases in the catchment area showed a significant correlation. As the clinical SARS-CoV-2 official case report chain takes time, viral RNA titre trends appeared more than 12 days earlier than clinical data, demonstrating the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning system. Parallel PCR analysis using seven primer and probe systems revealed similar gene copy numbers with E, ORF, RdRP2 and NSP9 assays. RdPP1 and NSP3 generally resulted in lower copy numbers, and in particular for N1 there was low correlation with the other assays. The occurrence of the N501Y mutation in the wastewater of Karlsruhe was consistent with the occurrence of the alpha-variant (B.1.1.7) in the corresponding individual clinical tests. In batch experiments SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable for several days under anaerobic conditions, but the copy numbers decreased rapidly in the presence of dissolved oxygen. Overall, this study shows that wastewater-based epidemiology is a sensitive and robust approach to detect trends in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage, contributing to successful pandemic management.},

    abstract = {Identification of the nucleotide sequences encoding antibiotic resistance elements and determination of their association with antibiotic resistance are critical to improve surveillance and monitor trends in antibiotic resistance. Current methods to study antibiotic resistance in various environments rely on extensive deep sequencing or laborious culturing of fastidious organisms, both of which are heavily time-consuming operations. An accurate and sensitive method to identify both rare and common resistance elements in complex metagenomic samples is needed. Referencing the sequences in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database, we designed a set of 37,826 probes to specifically target over 2,000 nucleotide sequences associated with antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria. Testing of this probe set on DNA libraries generated from multidrug-resistant bacteria to selectively capture resistance genes reproducibly produced higher numbers of reads on target at a greater length of coverage than shotgun sequencing. We also identified additional resistance gene sequences from human gut microbiome samples that sequencing alone was not able to detect. Our method to capture the resistome enables a sensitive means of gene detection in diverse environments where genes encoding antibiotic resistance represent less than 0.1\% of the metagenome.},
